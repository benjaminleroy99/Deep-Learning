# Deep Learning


This repository contains several works done for my deep learning class at Imperial College London.

First file is about how to create generative models with the implementation of a VAE and a deep convolutional GAN.

Second file is about a work on convolutional neural networks  with the implementation of an RNN, GRU and an LSTM model (uni and bi-directionnal) and some theory about RNNs.
